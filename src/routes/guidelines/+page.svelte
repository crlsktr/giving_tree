		<h3 class="h3 text-center">Why Gift Cards?</h3>
		<p class="text-justify p-4">
			After talking with the families that we wanted to help, we decided to collect gift cards for
			them instead of gifts. This way they can have the experience of shopping for their loved ones
			and picking out something special for them. Your generosity this season will help families
			twice as much as they experience the joy of giving as well as receiving something special on
			Christmas Day.
		</p>

		<h3 class="h3 text-center">How can I sign up?</h3>
		<p class="text-justify p-4">
			Select the gift cards you can donate on the Home page of this website, then click Give at the
			bottom of the page. This will draft an email message where you can let us know how many of
			each type of gift card you want to give! Any amount is appreciated!
		</p>
